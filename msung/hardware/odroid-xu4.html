              <strong>Update: </strong>
              I got a VU7 and an accompanying shell (saved a fair bit on shipping piggybacking on Commons' regular pop shipments :D) and I'm pretty happy with the end result - a cute little extra desktop for surfing/IRCing/reading when I'm in the living room!<br/>

            <p>After setting up a <a href="raspberry-pi.html">Raspberry Pi as a streaming source</a> for my analog audio system, and seeing the Odroid HC1 perform well as a CDN for Commons.host, I started thinking about getting another SBC that would run Kali for playing CTF. The <a href="https://magazine.odroid.com/odroid-xu4">Odroid XU4</a> looked like it would handle the job well with a nice 2GB RAM and octa core CPUs - at a tiny $59.</p>
            <p><img src="../assets/images/xu4-out-of-box.jpg"></p>
            <p>Flashing Kali on was straightforward, though handling an eMMC for the first time I felt I had to be extra gentle with all the tiny little pins. After that it was simply snap in, close the case and screw it tight.</p>

            <p>Some might point out that the lack of a WiFi module makes the Pi a better option, but in this case it wasn't a big deal - I had an Alfa WiFi adapter lying around so I could put the box anywhere in the house that was convenient.</p>

            <p>So far it's working without any hitches, so props to the folks at HardKernel for making computing affordable and Offensive Security for maintaining a XU-3/4 friendly version of Kali. I remember when machines were pricey beasts, now it's merely $100 to get a working setup - we live in good times.</p>
            <p>I love it that I retain the productivity of NixOS on my main machine at home but whenever I want to play script kiddie at CTF challenges I just SSH into the XU4, load up a <span class="tilda">screen</span> session and go at it! On a side note, did you know <span class="tilda">dirbuster</span> can be run headless?</p>
