          <h3>A split "fanned" ortho keyboard</h3>
          <section>
            <p>Having spend almost a year typing on the Kinesis Advantage both at work and at home after learning to touch type, I got a little curious about one of those DIY keyboard kits. Yes, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/mechmarket">/r/mechmarket</a> can be a dangerous place...</p>
            <p>My first mechanical keyboard was a Ducky with cherry red switches, and then a Topre Realforce came about shortly after. I missed the quiet and lighter feel of those, though that's not to say I don't like the brown switches that the Kinesis keyboards come with. Choices... as they say.</p>
            <p>So when I heard about the <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard?variant=2650673709086" target="_blank">Iris keyboard</a>, I decided to build a one with a mix of Kailh boxed reds switches with Tealios for the thumb keys. I will avoid elaborating too much on the build process, there's already a very nice <a href="https://docs.keeb.io/iris-build-guide/" target="_blank">build guide</a> published by the guys at Keeb.io.</p>
            <p>If you're handy with a soldering iron, this will take you around an hour to two to put together. Flashing the firmware with QMK is also pretty straightforward, nothing complicated here. I replicated most of the layout on the Kinesis on the default layer, adding one more for some additional symbol and arrow keys but that's pretty much it. (I don't like switching between layers to be honest, I find the whole process too slow but that's just me)</p>
            <p>I am waiting on the tented middle layers; they were out of stock when I ordered the kit - but I'm already enjoying my new workhorse. My hands are still a good 10WPM faster when I'm on the Kinesis, but these are really quiet to type on and comparable on the comfort.</p>
            <p>Here's a mugshot:</p>
