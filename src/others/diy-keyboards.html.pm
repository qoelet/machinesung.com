  ◊h3{Typing for work}
  ◊p{Like a lot of folks, I didn't really start with touch typing proper but rather adopted a "hunt and peck" approach. But sometime early 2017, I decided to work on changing that due to some mild symptoms of RSI and also to increase my typing accuracy. I suffered a month of painful transition before gaining some success touch typing at about 60wpm in ◊a[#:href "https://colemak.com/"]{Colemak}. Since then, with the fact that I do type for a living, I've reached a stable rate of 75 to 80 wpm.}
  ◊p{I've since moved away from the standard keyboards to split◊string->symbol{dash}ortholinear◊string->symbol{dash}tilted variants, my main workhorses being the ◊a[#:href "https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/"]{Kinesis Advantage} at the office and my ◊a[#:href "https://keeb.io/collections/frontpage/products/iris-keyboard-split-ergonomic-keyboard?variant=8034004860958"]{Iris} at home.}
  ◊h3{Typing for fun}
  ◊p{I like taking breaks going to ◊a[#:href "https://play.typeracer.com/"]{Typeracer}. It's a good way to practice words that might not necessarily come under my daily programming vocabulary. I'm almost at a thousand races now at the time of writing this entry.}
  ◊p{I also enjoyed ◊a[#:href "http://epistorygame.com/"]{Epistory ◊string->symbol{dash} Typing Chronicles}. If you like a simple action and adventure game that makes you type this is definitely one to go for.}
